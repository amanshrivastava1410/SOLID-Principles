# SOLID-Principles
This repository consists info about the SOLID Principles.

**SOLID:** Acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles. These principles establishes practices for developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending it as the project grows. The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which we should avoid in our code.

**S:** Single Responsibility Principle
**O:** Open-Closed Principle
**L:** Liskov Subsitution Principle
**I:** Interface Segregration Principle
**D:** Dependancy Inversion Principle

1. Single-Responsibility Principle **(SRP)**: A class should have one and only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one job or purpose within the software system.
2. Open/Closed Principle **(OCP)**: Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, we should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.
